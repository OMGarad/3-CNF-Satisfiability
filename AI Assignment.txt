The report will be evaluated based on the 4 questions.
One question is to try various wasy to improve the algorithm. So we must mentioned what all we have tried,
results we got and why we chose one way of improving algo over another.

Format should be clear. That's it. Length can be anything.

THE ONLY VARIABLE THING IS NO. OF APPROACHES TRIED.

We have 50 variables in the 3-CNF clause. Hence, we have 2^50 different possible states (each variable can be T or F).

We want to maximize the no. of oercentage of satisfies clauses.

So all the clauses combined have 50 variables. But we want to find a model that maximizes the %age of satisfied clauses

Not all the variables may be used. We may use a few of them. But we will still have T/F values.
One state is a boolean array of size 50, with truth values assigned to all 50 variables.

In order to make the model(state) that maximizes the no. of satisfied (i.e. true clauses), we use genetic algorithm.
Fitness function = Percentage of clauses that are satisfied in the 3-CNF sentence.




First, implement the version of the GA algorithm given in the textbook. Assume, that
initially all the states in the population are uniformly randomly selected from the state
space. For the first algorithm, let the population size be 20.

The GA starts with k randomly generated states. So in the question, we initialize k to 20.

Next, come up with a variant of the GA algorithm that is able to nd the model having
the maximum fitness function value as quickly as possible. In other words, you must
try to improve the algorithm such that the fitness function value is maximized and the
running time is minimized. To improve the algorithm, you can make changes to any
aspect of the Genetic Algorithm.
